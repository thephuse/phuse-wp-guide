# Updating Plugins and Wordpress Core

Upon logging in to your admin area, you may occasionally see notifications that there are updates available for either Wordpress or one or more of the installed plugins. **If you decide to run any updates on your own, please note that incompatibilities resulting from the update(s) may affect the performance of your site or bring it down entirely.** It is very important you take a backup for your site files and database prior to performing **any** updates.
