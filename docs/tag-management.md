# Tag Management

You can add / remove tags on a specific Post within that Post in the editor.

New tags can be added either while editing or creating a Post or via Posts > Tags. Fill out (at a minimum) the tag name to add a new tag via this second route. 

To globally edit an existing tag, go to Posts > Tags and click on the name of the tag you would like to access. Edit any necessary fields in the window that appears and click update.

To globally remove/delete an existing tag, go to Posts > Tags and hover over the name of the Tag you would like to remove. Click the Delete link that appears below the tag name upon hover.
