# Adding New Posts

Click on Posts in the left column, then click Add New. A new editable post will open where you can start writing your content.

The name of the Post should go in the first blank box ([Image 3, Item A](../resources/image-3-edit-post.html)).

Your actual post content can go in the larger box below the headline area ([Image 3, Item B](../resources/image-3-edit-post.html)) -- you should be on the "Visual" tab rather than "HTML" ([Image 3, Item C](../resources/image-3-edit-post.html)). Type your content here as you would in Word or any other text editing program.

For text formatting and more content options, see [Content Entry and Formatting](../content-entry-and-formatting/overview.html).

### Categories

Apply any applicable categories in the Categories section on the right side ([Image 3, Item D](../resources/image-3-edit-post.html)) by selecting the checkbox next to the one(s) you would like to add. A post can belong to multiple categories. For more information, view [Category Management](../category-management.html).

### Tags

Apply any applicable tags in the Tags section on the right side ([Image 3, Item E](../resources/image-3-edit-post.html)) by typing in the desired tag or choosing from the most used tags. If typing directly, note that suggested matches will show for existing tags in the system. You can either click the link to the existing tag that appears or just continue typing manually. A post can be assigned multiple tags. For more information, view [Tag Management](../tag-management.html).
