# Adding New Pages

Click on Pages in the left column, then click Add New. A new editable page will open where you can start writing your content.

The name of the Page should go in the first blank box ([Image 1, Item A](../resources/image-1-edit-page.html)).

Your actual page content can go in the larger box below the headline area ([Image 1, Item B](../resources/image-1-edit-page.html)) -- you should be on the "Visual" tab rather than "HTML" ([Image 1, Item C](../resources/image-1-edit-page.html)). Type your content here as you would in Word or any other text editing program.

For text formatting and more content options, see [Content Entry and Formatting](../content-entry-and-formatting/overview.html).

### Page Attributes

In the Page Attributes section on the right side ([Image 1, Item D](../resources/image-1-edit-page.html)), you will see the header "Parent" with a drop down menu. If the page you are creating is a child / sub-page of another page (for instance, if you wanted to create a "Meet the Team" page to go along with an "About Us" page), select the name of the "parent" page in the drop down (in the previous example, you would select "About Us" when editing the "Meet the Team" page).

If the page is not a subsection of another page, leave the Page Attributes section as is.

### Publishing Pages

When you're ready to post your page to your live site, click Publish on the right ([Image 1, Item E](../resources/image-1-edit-page.html)). This will change the page's status from Draft to Published and put it live on your site.

To save any changes you make after the status is set to Published, click on the Update button that now appears where the Publish button used to appear.

To edit that status at anytime (for example, if you Published the post before you were ready and need to set it back to draft), click on the Edit link next to the Status listing on the right. Select your desired status from the drop down and click OK.
