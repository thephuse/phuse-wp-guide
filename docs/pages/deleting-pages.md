# Deleting Pages

Should you need to delete a page, you can do so by clicking on Pages in the left column, which will bring up a list of all of your existing posts in the main window.  You can do one of three things:

1. Click on the check box next to the title of the page(s) you would like to delete ([Image 2, Item A](../resources/image-2-pages.html)). Select Move To Trash from the Bulk Actions drop down ([Image 2, Item B](../resources/image-2-pages.html)), then click Apply. This is useful for deleting multiple items.

2. Hover over the title of the page you would like to delete. You will see some links appear below the title, including one that says Trash. Click this to delete the page.

3. Click on the page title, and open the page in question. Click on the “Move to Trash” link to delete the page.
