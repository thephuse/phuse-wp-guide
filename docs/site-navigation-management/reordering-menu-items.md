# Reordering Menu Items

To reorder menu items, simply hover over the item youâ€™d like to move until you see the "move" cursor appear then click and drag the item to the desired location within the menu. If it should be a top level element (meaning not nested under a parent element in a drop down menu), make sure the item is fully aligned to the left with the other top level items. If it is indented slightly, Wordpress will interpret this as a nested item.

Click Save Menu to save your changes.
