# Adding Custom Links

If you would like to add a menu item with a custom link rather than a link to a page or post, you can do so via the Custom Links section ([Image 5, Item D](../resources/image-5-menus.html)). Upon expanding this section, you can fill in the link (make sure to include the "http://" portion) and specify the label for the link.
