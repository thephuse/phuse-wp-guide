# Deleting Users

To delete a user, Administrator accounts can go to Users and delete the applicable User via methods similar to those listed under [Deleting Pages](../pages/deleting-pages.html). Upon deleting a user, you will be prompted to either delete all content created by that user or reassign that personâ€™s existing posts to another user.
