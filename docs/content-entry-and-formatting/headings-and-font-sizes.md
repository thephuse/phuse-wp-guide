# Headings and Font Sizes

To change the font-size of a particular set of words, highlight the words you want to change. Click on the drop down menu in the toolbar under the Bold and Italics icons ([Image 4, Item D](../resources/image-4-formatting-toolbar.html)). Pick the formatting you want to use. **NOTE:** Avoid using "Heading 1" as much as possible as overuse can interfere with your search engine optimization.
