# Overview

You can use the items in the toolbar ([Image 1, Item F](../resources/image-1-edit-page.html)) to format your text â€“ such as bold, italics, centering, links, etc. (Hover over the items in the toolbar to see what they represent if you're unsure.) Be sure to turn on the "kitchen sink" ([Image 4, Item A](../resources/image-4-formatting-toolbar.html)) to view all items in the toolbar.
