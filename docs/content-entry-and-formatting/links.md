# Links

**To add a link** within your content, highlight the word(s) you want to serve as the text of the link and click on the chain icon ([Image 4, Item C](../resources/image-4-formatting-toolbar.html)).  A box will appear where you can add the web address to which you are linking. If you would like the link to open in a new tab upon click, click the gear icon to see the link options and select the checkbox for "Open link in a new tab". Fill in the Title field in this link options area if you'd like a title to appear when users hover over the link (this is not a required field but is best practices). Click the Add Link or blue arrow icon (depending on the screen you're on) and your link will be added to the selected content.

**To edit a link**, click within the text serving as the link and click on the pen (Edit) icon.

**To remove a link**, click within the text serving as the link and click on the "x" (remove) icon.
