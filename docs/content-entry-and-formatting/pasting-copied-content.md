# Pasting Copied Content

If you are pasting content you've copied from a Microsoft Word document or another web source, click on the "Paste as text" icon ([Image 4, Item B](../resources/image-4-formatting-toolbar.html)). This will help remove any formatting that may be attached to the text behind the scenes, which can create problems for web views.

You can preview your page at anytime by clicking on the Preview button to the right.
Click Save Draft to save your changes along the way. ([Image 1, Item G](../resources/image-1-edit-page.html))
