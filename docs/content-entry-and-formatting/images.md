# Images

**To add an image to a page**, place your cursor where you'd like the image to appear within your content and click on Add Media ([Image 4, Item E](../resources/image-4-formatting-toolbar.html)). In the window that appears, you can choose whether to Upload Files from your computer (use when adding new images) or add items from your Media Library (images that have previously been uploaded to your site). When uploading a new file, follow the prompts and edit the image Title and Alt Text after it uploads. Set your desired alignment, link for the image (if required) and size then click Insert into Page to add to your page.


**To edit an image after it has been added**, click on the image in the edit window and icons will appear over it that allow you to adjust the alignment or edit the image options. Click the "x" (remove) icon to delete it.
