# Wordpress Content Management Structure

Wordpress organizes content into two types: 

1. [Pages](../pages/adding-new-pages.html)<br>
Pages are typically your more static content -- those pages that donâ€™t change often such as your Home, About and Contact pages.

2. [Posts](../posts/adding-new-posts.html)<br>
Posts are typically your more dynamic content such as news articles, blog entries, and other content that may need to be organized by category.
