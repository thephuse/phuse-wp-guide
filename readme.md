# Phuse General Wordpress Guide Documentation

## About
A general Wordpress usage guide designed to guide those unfamiliar with Wordpress through some of the content management system's basics.

This documentation was created with  [couscous.io](http://couscous.io/) on a custom theme.

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repo. All changes should be made to the `master` branch. No work should be completed or committed to the `gh-pages` branch.
2. In your project directory run: `composer global require couscous/couscous`. 
3. Run `couscous preview` to preview the site locally. By default, the local site will run at http://localhost:8000.
4. To deploy to the live site run `couscous deploy`.

Review the [couscous.io install instructions](http://couscous.io/docs/getting-started.html) for further information, options and troubleshooting tips.

## Editing Content
All pages are written in Markdown. Editable content files are available in the `docs` directory. Theme files (built with Twig and straight CSS) can be found in the `website` directory.
